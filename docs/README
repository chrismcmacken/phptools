Licensing
-------------------------------
All contributed code should include the license statement at the top of each 
source file. The license statement can be found in docs/license.

Directory Naming Convention
-------------------------------
Each package or tool should be placed in it's own directory and be included by
including a single file in any project. Each package should also have a README
file inside of it's root folder describing how to use the package. For example 
the DB project would reside inside of a directory called DB in the root of the 
repository, with a README document at /DB/README that explains how to use the
project.
